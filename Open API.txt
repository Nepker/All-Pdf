Open API:
Agenda 
-Introduction to OpenAPI
-Better practice for reusable components
-OpenAPI in postman for documentation,tests and more
-Resources 
-Q/A

We Learned about:
-API-First(aka design-first) using OpenAPI
-Reusable components
-Boilerplate code snippets
-Schema Validation 
-Testing,documentation
-Version control ,versioning
-Mock servers
-Integrations(CI/CD,Deployment and observability)

More things to notice and work :
-Multi-file schema support
-Partner API network
-More APM integrations
-No-code flows in public workspaces and so more,
